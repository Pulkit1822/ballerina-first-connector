Welcome to the Ballerina First Connector project! This README will guide you through the basics of Ballerina and how to create a connector to interact with external services.

### Learning Outcomes

1. **Understanding Ballerina Basics**:
    - **Imports**: You learned how to import necessary modules in Ballerina, such as `ballerina/http` for HTTP client functionality and `ballerina/io` for input/output operations.
    - **Main Function**: You understood the structure of a Ballerina program, including the `main` function which serves as the entry point.

2. **HTTP Client Usage**:
    - **Creating an HTTP Client**: You learned how to create an HTTP client using `http:Client` to interact with external services.
    - **Making HTTP Requests**: You understood how to make HTTP GET requests using the `get` method of the `http:Client` object.
    - **Handling Responses**: You learned how to handle HTTP responses, including checking for errors and extracting the payload.

3. **Error Handling**:
    - **Using `check`**: You learned how to use the `check` keyword to handle errors in Ballerina. This ensures that any errors encountered during the execution of a statement are propagated up the call stack.

4. **Working with JSON**:
    - **Extracting JSON Payloads**: You understood how to extract JSON payloads from HTTP responses using the `getJsonPayload` method.
    - **Printing JSON Data**: You learned how to print JSON data to the console using the `io:println` function.

5. **Project Structure and Configuration**:
    - **Ballerina Project Structure**: You gained knowledge about the typical structure of a Ballerina project, including the use of configuration files like `Ballerina.toml`.
    - **Gradle Integration**: You learned how to integrate Gradle with a Ballerina project for building and managing dependencies.

6. **Sanitization Practices**:
    - **Input and Output Sanitization**: You understood the importance of sanitizing inputs and outputs to ensure data integrity and security.

7. **Running Ballerina Programs**:
    - **Using the `bal` Command**: You learned how to compile and run Ballerina programs using the `bal` command.

By working through this project, you have gained a comprehensive understanding of how to create, configure, and run a Ballerina connector to interact with external services.
